# fraud_detection

#### Python 3.7 was used for this project. The packages needed can be found and installed via the requirements.txt file.
#### The whole pipeline of the assignment can be found in the ipynb file.
#### Also the code for each part of the assignment can be found in a separate python file. The title of the files are representative.
#### **Note**: For the bonus task, the extracted features are loaded from a pickle file as they take much time to be extracted. If you want to extract them by yourself, uncomment the relevant part of the code.
