## Instructions

The implementation was done in Python 3.7.

Each task of the assignment can be found in the relevant file. 
Also, for each one there is a ipynb file, where the flow is more sound.

All the required packages are included in the *requirements.txt* file.

Note that in some cases we use pickle files to load the data instead 
of extracting them again (the extraction code is commented),
as it is time demanding. Also the parameters for the profiling task 
with HMM are see manually, but can run the tuning function by 
uncommenting it.

### Important
In order to run the code you should have the datasets for 
both scenarios 10 and 13. In particular, you should create a directory 
named *datasets* and add there the aforementioned datasets named 
*CTU-Malware-Capture-Botnet-51* and *CTU-Malware-Capture-Botnet-54*
respectively.
