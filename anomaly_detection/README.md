## Instructions

The implementation was done in Python 3.7.

Each task of the assignment can be found in the relevant directory. 
Also, for each one there is a ipynb file, where the flow is more clear.

All the required packages are included in the *requirements.txt* file.
Note that for the last task *pytorch* and *pytorchvision* packages are required.
All the required packages are installed automatically by running the first cell of the relative ipynb file.

!! LSTM and ARMA models requires a significant amount of time to run.
